### Step 1: Initialize Vault

When you first open 0xio, you'll see three options:

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Create New Wallet" icon="plus">
    Generate a fresh wallet with new recovery phrase
  </Card>
  <Card title="Import Wallet" icon="file-import">
    Restore existing wallet using recovery phrase
  </Card>
  <Card title="Watch Mode" icon="eye">
    Monitor an address without private key access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Select **"Create New Wallet"** to generate a new wallet.

### Step 2: Secure Your Recovery Phrase

<Warning>
**CRITICAL SECURITY INFORMATION**

Your 12-word Recovery Phrase is the master key to your funds. 0xio generates this phrase **locally on your device** using BIP39 standard with cryptographic randomness.

**If you lose this phrase, your funds are permanently inaccessible.**

0xio cannot recover lost phrases as they never leave your device.
</Warning>

#### Best Practices - DO:

- Write it down on paper immediately
- Store in a fireproof safe
- Consider metal backup plates (Cryptosteel, etc.) for long-term storage
- Split across multiple secure locations for large holdings
- Test your backup by importing on a second device

#### Best Practices - DON'T:

- Store in cloud services (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud, etc.)
- Take photos of your phrase
- Store in email or messaging apps
- Store digitally on internet-connected devices
- Share with anyone, including support staff

### Step 3: Verify Your Phrase

0xio will ask you to confirm several words in random order. This ensures you've recorded the phrase correctly.

### Step 4: Set Password

Create a strong password to protect your wallet on this device:

- **Minimum:** 12 characters recommended
- **Complexity:** Use uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- **Storage:** Use a password manager for best security
- **Encryption:** Password protects your vault with AES-GCM 256-bit encryption

<Info>
**Note:** This password only locks the wallet on your current device. Your recovery phrase is what actually controls your funds across all devices.
</Info>

## Importing an Existing Wallet

If you already have a 0xio wallet or Octra-compatible wallet:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Import">
    Click "Import Wallet" on the welcome screen
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Recovery Phrase">
    Enter your 12-word or 24-word Recovery Phrase

    - Words must be in the correct order
    - Use spaces between words
    - All lowercase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Device Password">
    Create a new password for this device
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete">
    Your wallet and balances will be restored automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Watch Mode

Monitor any Octra address without controlling it:

1. Select "Watch Mode"
2. Enter the Octra address (`oct1...`)
3. Give it a nickname for easy identification
4. View balance and transaction history (read-only)

**Use Cases:**
- Monitoring cold wallet balances
- Tracking multisig accounts
- Observing project treasury addresses
- Monitoring children's wallets

<Note>
Watch Mode provides view-only access. You cannot send transactions or sign messages in this mode.
</Note>
