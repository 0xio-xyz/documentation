## Your Wallet Address

- **Format:** `oct...` (47 characters)
- **Example:** `octabc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678satu901`

  <Step title="View Address">
    Your wallet address is displayed prominently
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy or Share">

## Receiving Public Transfers

When someone sends you a public transfer:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Transaction Broadcast">
    Sender broadcasts transaction to network
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validation">
    Validators confirm the transaction (3-5 seconds)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Credit">
    Funds appear in your **Public Balance** immediately
  </Step>
  <Step title="Notification">
    You receive an in-wallet notification
  </Step>
</Steps>

### No Action Required

Public transfers are automatic. Just share your address and wait for confirmation!

## Receiving Private Transfers

Private (FHE-encrypted) transfers may require an additional claim step.

### Why Claiming Exists

This design:
- Gives recipients control over when gas fees are paid
- Prevents spam to inactive wallets
- Allows recipients to validate transfers before claiming

### Claiming Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Notification">
    You see a "Pending Transfer" notification in your wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Navigate to Privacy Tab">
    Go to Encrypt/Decrypt section
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Pending Transfers">
    See list of unclaimed private transfers
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Claim">
    Click "Claim" next to the pending transfer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm the transaction (small gas fee applies)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credited">
    Funds move to your **Private Balance** after confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Claim Gas Fees

- **Typical Cost:** 5,000-10,000 OU
- **Paid By:** Recipient (you)
- **Why:** Decryption and state update require computation

<Info>
Some private transfers are automatically claimed if the sender pays for the full gas cost. Check your notification details.
</Info>

## Monitoring Incoming Funds

### Transaction History

View all received funds in the **History** tab:

1. Filter by "Received"
2. See sender addresses
3. View amounts and timestamps
4. Check confirmation status

### External Monitoring

Use the **0xio Telegram Bot** for real-time alerts:

- Instant notifications to Telegram
- Monitor multiple wallets
- Privacy mode available
- [Learn more about the bot](/products/telegram-bot)

## Address Book

Save addresses that frequently send you funds:

1. Go to **Settings > Address Book**
2. Click "Add Contact"
3. Enter name and address
4. Add notes (optional)

**Benefits:**
- Quickly identify senders
- Verify legitimate addresses
- Avoid phishing attempts

## Best Practices

### Security

<Warning>
**Never share your private key or recovery phrase!**

Only share your public wallet address (`oct...`). Anyone asking for your private key or recovery phrase is trying to steal your funds.
</Warning>

### Address Verification

When receiving large amounts:

1. **Verify address through multiple channels**
2. **Send a small test amount first**
3. **Confirm receipt before large transfer**
4. **Double-check address character-by-character**

### Privacy Considerations

**For Public Transfers:**
- Sender can see your current balance
- Transaction amount is visible to everyone
- Consider using a dedicated public address

**For Private Transfers:**
- Sender only knows your address
- Amount is encrypted
- Your balance remains confidential

<Tip>
**Pro Tip:** For recurring private payments (like salary), create a dedicated address to organize your finances while maintaining privacy.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### "I sent funds but don't see them"

1. **Check transaction status** on block explorer
2. **Wait for confirmations** (up to 30 seconds during congestion)
3. **Verify correct address** was used
4. **Check if it's a private transfer** requiring claim
5. **Refresh your balance** manually

### "Private transfer isn't showing"

1. Go to **Privacy Tab**
2. Click **"Scan for Pending"**
3. Wait for wallet to query blockchain
4. Claim any found transfers

### "Address rejected as invalid"

- Ensure address starts with `oct`
- Verify exactly 47 characters
- Check for typos or extra spaces
- Try copying directly from sender
