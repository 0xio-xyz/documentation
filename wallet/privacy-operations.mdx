The Privacy tab is your control center for Octra's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) capabilities, allowing you to move funds between public and private states.

## Understanding Privacy Operations

0xio gives you complete control over your financial visibility through three main operations:

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Encrypt" icon="lock">
    Move funds from Public → Private
  </Card>
  <Card title="Decrypt" icon="unlock">
    Move funds from Private → Public
  </Card>
  <Card title="Claim" icon="hand-holding-heart">
    Accept incoming private transfers
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Encrypting Funds (Public → Private)

"Shielding" makes your funds invisible to blockchain observers.

### When to Encrypt

- Before making confidential purchases
- Protecting salary or business payments
- Hiding holdings from public view
- Preparing for private swaps on DEX
- Enhancing overall financial privacy

### How to Encrypt

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Privacy Tab">
    Click "Encrypt/Decrypt" in main navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Encrypt">
    Choose the "Encrypt" option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Input the amount to shield from your Public Balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Fee">
    Check the gas fee estimate (10,000 OU standard)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Click "Encrypt" and sign with your password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
    Typically 5-8 seconds for blockchain confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Technical Process

When you encrypt funds:

1. **Local Encryption:** Your device performs FHE encryption on the amount
2. **Transaction Creation:** Encrypted payload is prepared
3. **Signing:** You sign the transaction with your private key
4. **Broadcast:** Encrypted transaction sent to network
5. **Validation:** Validators process without seeing the amount
6. **Confirmation:** Funds move to your Private Balance

<Info>
**Privacy Guarantee:** The encryption happens entirely on your device before any data touches the internet. Validators never see your plaintext amount.
</Info>

### Costs

| Amount | Gas Fee | Processing Time |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| < 1,000 OCT | 10,000 OU | 5-8 seconds |
| ≥ 1,000 OCT | 30,000 OU | 5-8 seconds |

## Decrypting Funds (Private → Public)

"Unshielding" makes your funds publicly visible again.

### When to Decrypt

- Sending to exchanges that don't support FHE
- Interacting with public DeFi protocols
- When faster transaction speed is needed
- Reducing gas costs for routine operations

### How to Decrypt

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Privacy Tab">
    Go to Encrypt/Decrypt section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Decrypt">
    Choose the "Decrypt" option
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Specify amount to unshield from Private Balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Fee">
    Check gas fee estimate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Sign and broadcast the transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirmation">
    Funds appear in Public Balance after confirmation
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Once funds are decrypted to your public balance, their movement becomes visible on the blockchain. Consider your privacy needs carefully.
</Warning>

## Claiming Private Transfers

When someone sends you a private (FHE-encrypted) transfer, you may need to claim it.

### Finding Pending Transfers

1. Navigate to **Privacy Tab**
2. Look for "Pending Transfers" section
3. Click **"Scan for Pending"** to query blockchain
4. Pending transfers appear in a list

### Claim Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="View Pending Transfer">
    See details of incoming private transfer:
    - Sender address
    - Estimated amount (if disclosed)
    - Timestamp
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Claim">
    Press "Claim" button next to the transfer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Gas Fee">
    Small fee required for decryption and state update
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Transaction">
    Sign the claim transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Funds Added">
    After confirmation, funds appear in your Private Balance
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Claim Fees

- **Typical:** 5,000-10,000 OU
- **Paid By:** Recipient (you)
- **Reason:** Computational cost of FHE decryption

### Bulk Claiming

If you have multiple pending transfers:

1. Select all transfers to claim
2. Click "Claim All"
3. Single transaction processes all claims
4. Save on gas fees

## Privacy Best Practices

### Maximize Privacy

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Keep Most Funds in Private Balance">
    Maintain majority of holdings in encrypted state. Only decrypt what you need for immediate use.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Separate Addresses">
    Consider using different addresses for public and private activities to reduce correlation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Encrypt Immediately After Receiving">
    When receiving public transfers, encrypt them quickly to minimize exposure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Batch Privacy Operations">
    If making multiple encrypt/decrypt operations, batch them to save on fees.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Balance Management Strategy

**Conservative Privacy Model:**
```text
Public Balance: 5-10% (for gas and immediate needs)
Private Balance: 90-95% (long-term holdings)
```

**Balanced Model:**
```text
Public Balance: 30% (active trading, DeFi)
Private Balance: 70% (savings, private transactions)
```

**Public-First Model:**
```text
Public Balance: 70% (frequent trading, lower fees)
Private Balance: 30% (selective privacy)
```

## Advanced Features

### Scheduled Privacy Operations

Set up automatic encryption of incoming funds:

1. Go to **Settings > Automation**
2. Enable "Auto-Encrypt Incoming"
3. Set threshold amount
4. All incoming public transfers above threshold automatically encrypt

### Privacy Presets (Upcoming Feature)

Save common privacy operations:

1. **Settings > Privacy Presets**
2. Create preset (e.g., "Monthly Shield: 1000 OCT")
3. One-click execution from dashboard

## Monitoring Privacy Operations

### Transaction History

View all privacy operations:

1. See all encrypt/decrypt operations
2. Track gas costs over time
3. Verify operation success

### Privacy Dashboard (Upcoming Feature)

Access detailed privacy metrics:

- Total funds encrypted/decrypted
- Privacy ratio over time
- Average gas costs
- Operation frequency

<Note>
**Coming Soon:** Privacy analytics dashboard to help you optimize your privacy strategy and gas costs.
</Note>

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Balance for Encryption"

- Check you have enough **Public Balance** to cover both amount + gas
- Minimum: Amount + 30,000 OU worth of OCT

### "Claim Transaction Failed"

- Ensure sufficient OCT for gas fees
- Try refreshing pending transfers list
- Transfer may have been auto-claimed

### "Decrypt Taking Too Long"

- Network congestion can delay operations
- Check transaction status in History
- Wait up to 30 seconds during peak times
- Consider increasing gas fee (OU)

<Tip>
For urgent privacy operations during network congestion, use the custom gas fee option to set a higher OU amount for priority processing.
