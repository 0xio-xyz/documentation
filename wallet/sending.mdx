0xio supports multiple ways to send OCT and tokens, with options for both public and private transactions.

## Standard Public Send

Send a transparent transaction visible on the blockchain.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Send Tab">
    Click "Send" in the main navigation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Recipient">
    Enter the recipient's Octra address (starts with `oct1...`)

    - Must be 47 characters
    - Validates automatically
    - Can paste or scan QR code
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Specify the amount to send

    - Enter in OCT units
    - Shows USD equivalent (if available)
    - Displays available balance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Source">
    Choose **"Public Balance"** as the source
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Transaction">
    Review the transaction details:

    - Recipient address
    - Amount to send
    - Network fee (10,000 OU or 30,000 OU if ≥1,000 OCT)
    - Total including fees
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm and Sign">
    Click "Send" and enter your password to sign
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Transaction Details

- **Speed:** 3-5 seconds
- **Privacy:** Transaction is visible on blockchain
- **Gas Cost:** 10,000 OU (standard)
- **Gas Cost (High Value):** 30,000 OU (amounts ≥1,000 OCT)

<Info>
High value transactions (≥1,000 OCT) automatically use 30,000 OU for enhanced security and priority processing.
</Info>

## Private Send

Send an FHE-encrypted transaction where the amount remains confidential.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Send Tab">
    Navigate to Send in the main menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Recipient">
    Input the recipient's Octra address
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Specify the amount to send
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Private Balance">
    Choose **"Private Balance"** as the source
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Encrypted Details">
    Review transaction information:

    - Recipient (visible)
    - Amount (will be encrypted)
    - Network fee (higher for FHE operations)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Confirm and sign the transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Private Transfers Work

1. **Local Encryption:** Your device encrypts the transaction amount using FHE
2. **Broadcast:** Encrypted payload is sent to the blockchain
3. **Validation:** Smart contracts perform validation on encrypted data
4. **Execution:** Transaction executes without revealing amount to validators
5. **Notification:** Recipient receives notification to claim funds

### Transaction Details

- **Speed:** 5-8 seconds
- **Privacy:** Amount encrypted, only addresses visible
- **Gas Cost:** Higher (varies, up to 30,000 OU for large amounts)

<Warning>
Private transfers may require the recipient to "claim" the transfer. They'll see a pending transfer notification in their wallet.
</Warning>

## Bulk Send

Send to multiple recipients in a single transaction batch.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Bulk Mode">
    Click "Bulk Send" tab
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Recipients">
    Add up to 50 addresses with individual amounts

    - Click "+ Add Recipient"
    - Enter address and amount for each
    - Remove entries with the trash icon
  </Step>
  <Step title="Choose Balance Type">
    Select Public or Private balance source
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Total">
    Review:

    - Total amount across all recipients
    - Per-recipient breakdown
    - Network fees (batch processing discount)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Batch">
    Sign the batch transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Benefits of Bulk Send

- **Cost Efficient:** Significantly reduced gas fees per transfer
- **Time Saving:** One signature for multiple transfers
- **Ideal For:**
  - Payroll and salary payments
  - Airdrops and token distributions
  - Multi-party settlements
  - Team payments

<Tip>
Bulk transfers can save up to 70% on gas fees compared to sending individual transactions.
</Tip>

## Transaction Priority

### Custom Network Fees

For advanced users, customize the **Operational Unit (OU)** fee to control transaction priority:

1. Click "Est. Network Fee" at the bottom of Send screen
2. Choose priority level:
   - **Standard:** 10,000 OU (default)
   - **High:** 30,000 OU (faster during congestion)
   - **Custom:** Set your own OU amount
3. Higher OU = faster inclusion in blocks

<Info>
During network congestion, higher OU values ensure your transaction is processed quickly.
</Info>

## Transaction States

### Pending

- Transaction submitted to network
- Awaiting validator confirmation
- Typically 3-10 seconds

### Confirmed

- Transaction included in block
- Funds transferred successfully
- Transaction hash available for explorer

### Failed

- Transaction rejected or reverted
- Funds safely returned to your wallet
- **Common causes:**
  - Insufficient balance for gas
  - Network connectivity issue
  - Invalid recipient address

## Adding a Memo

Include a message with your transaction:

1. Expand "Advanced Options"
2. Enter memo text (up to 256 characters)
3. **Note:** Memo is visible on blockchain for public sends
4. For private sends, memo is also encrypted

**Use Cases:**
- Payment references
- Invoice numbers
- Personal notes

<Warning>
Memos are permanent and cannot be edited after the transaction is confirmed.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

### Security

- Always double-check recipient addresses
- Send a small test transaction first for large amounts
- Verify addresses through multiple channels
- Be cautious of phishing attempts

### Privacy

- Use **Private Balance** for sensitive transactions
- Encrypt funds before private transfers
- Monitor pending claims for incoming private transfers

### Efficiency

- Use **Bulk Send** for multiple recipients
- Consider standard priority unless urgent
- Group similar transactions to save on fees
