0xio provides multiple layers of security to protect your funds and privacy.

## Auto-Lock

Automatically lock your wallet after periods of inactivity.

### Configuration

1. Navigate to **Settings > Security > Auto-Lock**
2. Select timeout period:
   - 5 minutes
   - 15 minutes (recommended)
   - 30 minutes
   - 1 hour
   - Never (not recommended)

### How It Works

- Timer resets with any wallet interaction
- Locked wallet requires password to reopen
- Protects against unauthorized access if you step away
- Active sessions close automatically

<Warning>
**Security Recommendation:** Use 15 minutes or less for shared or public computers.
</Warning>

## Password Management

### Changing Your Password

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Security Settings">
    Go to Settings > Security > Change Password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Current Password">
    Verify your identity with existing password
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter New Password">
    Create a strong new password (12+ characters)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm New Password">
    Re-enter to confirm
  </Step>
  <Step title="Apply Changes">
    Password updated immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Important:** Changing your password does NOT require your Recovery Phrase. The password only protects local access to your encrypted vault.
</Info>

### Password Requirements

- **Minimum:** 8 characters (12+ recommended)
- **Recommended:**
  - Mix of uppercase and lowercase
  - Include numbers
  - Include special characters (!@#$%^&*)
  - Avoid common words or patterns

## Recovery Phrase Management

### Viewing Your Recovery Phrase

<Warning>
**Extreme Caution:** Only view your recovery phrase in a secure, private location. Never screenshot or photograph it.
</Warning>

1. **Settings > Security > Show Recovery Phrase**
2. Enter your password
3. Write down all 12 words in order
4. Hide/close the view immediately

### Multiple Devices

Use your Recovery Phrase to access the same wallet on multiple devices:

- Each device can have its own password
- Balance changes sync via blockchain automatically
- Transactions from any device reflect on all devices
- No cloud synchronization required

### Device Security

**Recommended:**
- Different passwords per device
- Enable auto-lock on all devices
- Never store recovery phrase digitally
- Regular security audits

## Advanced Security Options

### Export Private Key

<Warning>
**Advanced Users Only:** Exporting your private key is rarely necessary and increases security risk.
</Warning>

**Use Cases:**
- Importing to other Octra-compatible wallets
- Advanced development and testing
- Cold storage solutions

**How to Export:**
1. **Settings > Advanced > Export Private Key**
2. Enter password
3. Copy private key (never screenshot)
4. Store securely (treat like recovery phrase)

### Transaction Signing

All transactions require explicit approval:

- **Review:** Every transaction shows full details
- **Confirm:** Password or biometric required
- **No Auto-Sign:** Even for connected dApps
- **Cancel Anytime:** Before signing completes

### Connection Management

#### Connected dApps

View and manage website connections:

1. **Settings > Connected Sites**
2. See all authorized dApps
3. View permissions granted
4. Revoke access anytime

#### Permission Types

| Permission | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `read_balance` | View your public balance |
| `view_address` | Access your wallet address |
| `send_transactions` | Request transaction signatures |
| `view_private_balance` | Access encrypted balance (requires explicit consent) |

<Tip>
**Best Practice:** Regularly audit connected dApps and revoke unused connections.
</Tip>

## Session Security

### Active Sessions

Monitor active wallet sessions:

- **Settings > Security > Active Sessions**
- View device/browser information
- Last activity timestamp
- Terminate sessions remotely

### Secure Logout

Always log out on shared devices:

1. Click lock icon in toolbar
2. Or **Settings > Lock Wallet**
3. Requires password to unlock

## Network Security

### RPC Endpoint Validation

0xio validates RPC endpoints before connecting:

- **Certificate Validation:** HTTPS only
- **Known Networks:** Pre-configured safe RPCs
- **Custom Networks:** Warning before connection

### Phishing Protection

Built-in protections against common attacks:

- **Address Validation:** Checks address format
- **Warning Banners:** Alerts for suspicious transactions
- **Domain Verification:** Highlights mismatched domains
- **Transaction Preview:** Always shows full details

## Security Best Practices

### DO:

- Enable auto-lock (15 minutes or less)
- Use a strong, unique password
- Store recovery phrase offline securely
- Regularly review connected dApps
- Verify addresses before sending
- Start with small test transactions
- Keep browser and extension updated

### DON'T:

- Share password or recovery phrase with anyone
- Store recovery phrase digitally
- Screenshot or photograph sensitive information
- Use the same password across services
- Leave wallet unlocked on shared devices
- Approve transactions without review
- Connect to untrusted dApps

## Emergency Procedures

### Compromised Device

If you suspect your device is compromised:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Secure Access on New Device">
    Install 0xio on a secure device using your recovery phrase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Transfer Funds">
    Immediately transfer all funds to a new wallet
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create New Wallet">
    Generate a new wallet with a fresh recovery phrase
  </Step>
  <Step title="Abandon Old Wallet">
    Never use the compromised wallet again
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Lost Recovery Phrase

<Warning>
**Critical:** If you lose your recovery phrase and lose access to all devices with the wallet:

**Your funds are PERMANENTLY INACCESSIBLE.**

0xio cannot recover lost recovery phrases. They are generated locally and never transmitted.
</Warning>

**Prevention:**
- Maintain multiple secure backups
- Consider metal backup solutions
- Store in separate physical locations
- Test recovery on a second device
