## What is 0xio?

**0xio** is the premier non-custodial wallet ecosystem for the **Octra Network**, designed to make encrypted blockchain computation usable, safe, and intuitive.

While Octra provides the underlying Layer-1 blockchain and cryptographic infrastructure, 0xio delivers the wallets, SDKs, and applications that allow users and developers to interact with Octra's fully encrypted execution model.

## Core Features

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Privacy by Default" icon="lock">
    0xio integrates Octra's **Hypergraph Fully Homomorphic Encryption (HFHE)** so balances, transfers, and application logic can remain encrypted throughout their lifecycle. Validators process encrypted payloads without learning their contents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Non-Custodial Security" icon="key">
    All keys are generated and stored locally. 0xio cannot freeze, access, or recover user funds. You maintain complete sovereignty over your assets with industry-standard cryptography (Ed25519, AES-256-GCM, BIP39).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Client-Side Encryption" icon="microchip">
    Sensitive data is encrypted **before** it is broadcast to the network. All FHE operations happen on your device, ensuring zero trust in intermediaries.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Dual Balance System" icon="scale-balanced">
    Maintain both Public and Private balances. Choose transparency for lower costs or privacy for confidential transactions. Move between them seamlessly with simple encrypt/decrypt operations.
  </Accordion>

## Why Privacy Matters

On most blockchains:
- Balances are public
- Transactions are globally visible
- Activity can be trivially tracked
- Financial privacy doesn't exist

With 0xio on Octra:
- Private balances by default
- Encrypted transactions without revealing amounts
- Applications that operate on private state
- Privacy enforced by cryptography, not trust
