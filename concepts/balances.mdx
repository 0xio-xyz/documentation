0xio wallet maintains two separate balance types, giving you complete control over your financial privacy.

## Public Balance

Your **Public Balance** is visible to everyone on the blockchain.

### Characteristics

- **Transparency:** Visible to anyone viewing the blockchain
- **Speed:** Faster transaction processing
- **Cost:** Lower gas fees (10,000 OU standard)
- **Compatibility:** Works with all protocols and services

### When to Use

- Standard interactions with public DeFi protocols
- Sending to exchanges that don't support FHE
- When transparency is beneficial or required
- Situations where speed and lower costs are priorities

## Private Balance

Your **Private Balance** is encrypted using FHE and only visible to you.

### Characteristics

- **Privacy:** Encrypted using FHE, completely confidential
- **Gas Costs:** Slightly higher (30,000 OU for amounts ≥ 1,000 OCT)
- **Security:** Complete financial privacy
- **Validation:** Transactions validated without revealing amounts

### When to Use

- Confidential transfers and payments
- Private trading and swaps
- Salary payments and business transactions
- Protecting wealth information from public view

<Info>
Your 0xio wallet displays both balances simultaneously, and you can move funds between them at any time using the Encrypt/Decrypt features.

## Moving Between Balances

### Encrypting Funds (Public → Private)

This process "shields" your funds, making them invisible to blockchain observers.

**Process:**
1. Navigate to the Encrypt tab
2. Enter the amount to shield
3. Review the gas fee estimate (10,000 OU standard)
4. Confirm the transaction
5. Wait for blockchain confirmation (typically 5-8 seconds)

**Technical Note:** Your device performs FHE encryption locally before broadcasting to the network.

### Decrypting Funds (Private → Public)

This "unshields" funds, making them visible on the blockchain.

**Process:**
1. Navigate to the Decrypt tab
2. Enter the amount to unshield
3. Review the gas fee
4. Confirm the transaction

## Network Fees

0xio abstracts raw gas costs into **Operational Units (OU)** to ensure predictable pricing:

| Transaction Type | OU Cost | When Applied |
|-----------------|---------|--------------|
| **Standard Transaction** | 10,000 OU | Default for most operations |
| **High Value Transaction** | 30,000 OU | Automatically applied when amount ≥ 1,000 OCT |
| **Custom Fees** | Variable | Manually set via "Network Fee" modal for priority |

<Tip>
During network congestion, you can manually override OU via the "Network Fee" modal for priority inclusion in the next block.
