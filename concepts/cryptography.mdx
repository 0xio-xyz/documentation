0xio implements industry-standard cryptographic algorithms to ensure the highest level of security for your assets.

## Signing Algorithm

**Ed25519** (Twisted Edwards Curve)

- High-speed signature generation and verification
- 256-bit security level
- Implemented via TweetNaCl.js for browser compatibility
- Resistant to side-channel attacks

## Hashing

- **SHA-256:** Primary hashing algorithm for address generation
- **HMAC-SHA512:** Used in key derivation processes

## Symmetric Encryption

**AES-GCM (256-bit)** for local vault protection

- Authenticated encryption mode
- Protects your encrypted keys on device
- Ensures data integrity and confidentiality

## Key Derivation (HD Wallets)

### Mnemonic Standard

**BIP39** - 12 or 24-word recovery phrases

- Standard: 12-word phrases (128-bit entropy)
- Extended: 24-word phrases (256-bit entropy)
- Dictionary: 2048 words from official BIP39 wordlist

### Seed Generation

**PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA512** with 2048 iterations

- Password-based key derivation function
- Converts mnemonic to cryptographic seed
- Salt: Configurable passphrase (optional)

### Derivation Path

```
m/345'/0'/0'/0'/0'/0'/0'/0'
```

- **Purpose (345'):** Octra Network specific hardened path
- All levels use hardened derivation for maximum security
- Prevents key leakage from public key exposure

## Address Format

0xio generates Octra addresses through a multi-step process:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Ed25519 Public Key">
    Derive public key from private key using Ed25519
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hash Public Key">
    Compute SHA-256 hash of the public key
  </Step>
  <Step title="Base58 Encoding">
    Encode the hash using Base58
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Prefix">
    Prefix with `oct` for Octra Network identification
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** A 47-character string (e.g., `oct1abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901`)

## Security Architecture

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Private Key Storage** | AES-256-GCM encrypted in browser local storage |
| **Session Management** | Auto-lock with configurable timeout |
| **Password Protection** | PBKDF2 with user-defined password |
| **Telemetry** | **Zero** - No tracking or analytics |
| **Network Communication** | HTTPS only, certificate pinning recommended |

<Warning>
**Privacy First:** 0xio implements zero telemetry. We never collect IP addresses, wallet addresses, or usage data.
</Warning>

## FHE Integration

While Octra handles the heavy lifting of Fully Homomorphic Encryption, 0xio:

1. **Encrypts locally:** Your device encrypts transaction data before broadcast
2. **Signs encrypted payloads:** Maintains authenticity without revealing content
3. **Decrypts locally:** Only your device can decrypt your private balance state

This ensures end-to-end privacy without trusting intermediaries.
