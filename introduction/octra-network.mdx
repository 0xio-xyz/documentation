Octra is a **privacy-preserving Layer-1 blockchain** built from the ground up to execute **encrypted computation on-chain**.

Unlike traditional blockchains, where data is either fully public or hidden using external techniques (ZK proofs, MPC, or trusted hardware), Octra allows:

- Transactions
- Smart contract logic
- Onchain state

to remain **encrypted at all times**, while still being executed and verified by the network.

<Info>
**In short:** Octra computes on data it cannot see.

0xio is designed specifically to expose this capability safely to end users.

## Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic primitive that allows arbitrary computation to be performed directly on encrypted data, without decryption.

On Octra, this enables:

- Validators to process transactions without seeing balances or inputs
- Smart contracts to execute logic over private state
- Verifiable outputs with no data leakage
- User data privacy enforced by cryptography, not trust

This is not privacy through obfuscation or offchain assumptions — It is **privacy enforced at the execution layer**.

## Hypergraph FHE (HFHE)

Traditional FHE is prohibitively slow. Octra addresses this with **HFHE (Hypergraph Fully Homomorphic Encryption)**.

HFHE differs fundamentally from lattice-based FHE approaches by:

- Mapping encrypted data onto **hypergraph incidence structures**
- Keeping encryption noise **localized**, not global
- Enabling massive parallel execution and bootstrapping
- Remaining CPU-friendly without specialized hardware

### What This Unlocks

- Parallel encrypted logic gate evaluation (AND / OR / XOR)
- Sub-10ms encrypted bootstrapping
- Practical encrypted throughput at Layer-1 scale

0xio abstracts these mechanics so users and developers benefit from encrypted execution **without interacting with cryptography directly**.

## Validator Work: Real Computation, Not Waste

Octra does not rely on hash-based mining.

Validators are rewarded for performing the **actual encrypted computation** required by the network:

- Executing encrypted transactions
- Running encrypted application logic
- Maintaining encrypted state
- Participating in validation and key management tasks

There is no expendable work.

<Note>
**Execution itself is the work being secured.**
</Note>

## Circles: Encrypted Execution Environments

Octra introduces **Circles**, isolated, on-chain execution environments that function like encrypted backend services.

Within a Circle, developers can:

- Deploy complex application logic
- Run code written in **Rust, C++, or WASM**
- Store and compute over encrypted state
- Control access without exposing raw data

Circles are best understood as:

**Private, verifiable, on-chain compute containers**

They scale independently, remain isolated, and inherit encrypted execution by default.

## How 0xio Fits In

0xio sits **above** Octra's execution layer.

- Octra provides encrypted computation
- 0xio provides usable interfaces, wallets, SDKs, and applications

Users interact with 0xio. 0xio securely interfaces with Octra.
