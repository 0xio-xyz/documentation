<Note>
  **Status: In Development**
  The 0xio DEX is currently in active development. Features described represent the planned functionality and may change before production release.
</Note>

## Overview

**0xio DEX** is the premier **Automated Market Maker (AMM)** built for the **Octra Network**, leveraging **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** to enable truly private trading.

### The Problem with Traditional DEXs

On standard decentralized exchanges:

- Your trade sizes are publicly visible
- Front-running bots exploit your transactions
- Trading strategies become transparent
- Competitors can track your activity
- MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction

### The 0xio DEX Solution

Trade tokens with **amount privacy** using FHE:

- **Input Privacy:** Swap amounts encrypted on-chain
- **Hidden Balances:** Account balances remain confidential
- **Front-Running Protection:** Bots can't see your trade size
- **Strategy Privacy:** Your trading patterns stay private

## Getting Started

### Connecting Your Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access DEX">
    Navigate to Swap tab in 0xio wallet or visit DEX interface
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wallet Auto-Connect">
    Your 0xio wallet connects automatically if using extension
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify Connection">
    Check connected status in top-right corner
  </Step>
  <Step title="View Balances">
    Your public and private balances display automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Interface

### Swap Card

The main trading interface includes:

- **From Token:** Token you're selling
- **To Token:** Token you're buying
- **Amount Input:** How much you want to swap
- **FHE Toggle:** Switch between public and private mode
- **Estimated Output:** Expected tokens received
- **Price Impact:** How your trade affects the pool
- **Swap Button:** Execute the transaction

### Privacy Toggle (Shield Button)

Control your trade privacy level:

#### FHE Off (Public Mode)

- Standard public swap
- Trade amounts visible on blockchain
- Faster execution (3-5 seconds)
- Lower gas costs
- Anyone can see your trade size
- Subject to front-running

#### FHE On (Shielded Mode) 🛡️

- Private swap with encrypted amounts
- Trade amount encrypted on your device
- Network validates without seeing amounts
- Higher gas costs
- Protection from front-running
- Complete trade privacy

<Tip>
**When to use FHE:** Large trades, sensitive strategies, or any time you want privacy.
</Tip>

## Making a Public Swap

For transparent, faster, cheaper swaps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Select Tokens">
    Choose token to sell from dropdown and token to buy
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Input amount to swap
  </Step>
  <Step title="Disable FHE">
    Ensure FHE toggle is OFF
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Details">
    Check:
    - Exchange rate
    - Estimated output
    - Price impact
    - Network fee
    - Slippage tolerance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Swap">
    Click "Swap" button
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm in Wallet">
    Approve transaction in popup
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Confirmation">
    Typically 3-5 seconds
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Public Swap Details

- **Speed:** 3-5 seconds
- **Privacy:** Amounts visible on-chain
- **Gas Cost:** ~15,000-20,000 OU
- **Best For:** Small trades, when privacy isn't critical

## Making a Private Swap

For confidential, front-running resistant trading:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check Private Balance">
    Ensure sufficient **Private Balance**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable FHE">
    Toggle FHE shield to ON
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Tokens">
    Choose trading pair
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Amount">
    Input swap amount
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review Encrypted Details">
    Review (amount will be encrypted):
    - Token pair
    - Estimated output range
    - Gas fee (higher for FHE)
    - Slippage settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute Swap">
    Click "Swap"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Local Encryption">
    Your device encrypts the swap amount
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">
    Approve encrypted transaction
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Processing">
    5-10 seconds for encrypted transaction
  </Step>
</Steps>

### How Private Swaps Work

1. **Device Encryption:** Your browser performs FHE encryption on swap amount
2. **Encrypted Broadcast:** Encrypted payload sent to blockchain
3. **Private Validation:** Smart contracts validate on encrypted data
4. **Encrypted Execution:** AMM processes swap without seeing amounts
5. **Private Receipt:** Tokens delivered to your Private Balance
6. **Zero Leakage:** Nobody sees your trade size

### Private Swap Details

- **Speed:** 5-10 seconds
- **Privacy:** Amounts fully encrypted
- **Gas Cost:** ~40,000-50,000 OU
- **Best For:** Large trades, strategic positions

<Warning>
Private swaps require sufficient **Private Balance**. If your funds are in Public Balance, encrypt them first using the Privacy tab.
</Warning>

## Slippage Protection

Control how much price movement you'll tolerate:

### Slippage Settings

| Setting | Recommended For |
|---------|----------------|
| **0.1%** | Stablecoins, high-liquidity pairs |
| **0.5%** | Standard tokens, moderate liquidity |
| **1.0%** | Lower liquidity, volatile pairs |
| **Custom** | Advanced users, specific strategies |

### Setting Slippage

1. Click settings icon
2. Select or enter slippage percentage
3. Higher slippage = more likely to execute, worse price
4. Lower slippage = better price, might fail

<Info>
During high volatility, consider increasing slippage to ensure your swap executes. You'll never pay more than your slippage tolerance.
</Info>

## Transaction States

### Pending 

- Transaction submitted to DEX contract
- Awaiting validator confirmation
- Typically 3-10 seconds
- Can't be cancelled once submitted

### Confirmed 

- Swap executed successfully
- Tokens in your wallet
- Transaction hash available
- View in block explorer

### Failed 

- Transaction rejected or reverted
- Funds safely returned
- **Common causes:**
  - Insufficient balance for gas
  - Price moved beyond slippage tolerance
  - Insufficient liquidity
  - Network connectivity issue

## Liquidity Pools (Coming Soon)

### Providing Liquidity

Earn fees by providing liquidity to trading pairs:

1. Select token pair
2. Deposit equal value of both tokens
3. Receive LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens
4. Earn portion of trading fees
5. Withdraw anytime

### Public Pools

- Standard AMM liquidity pools
- Transparent reserves and pricing
- Maximum composability
- Higher fee earnings potential

### Shielded Pools (Experimental)

- Privacy-enabled liquidity
- Encrypted pool balances
- Private LP positions
- FHE-validated trades

<Note>
Shielded pools are experimental and may have limitations during early phases. Start with public pools to understand the mechanics.
</Note>

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use FHE for Large Trades">
    Protect yourself from front-running on significant positions by enabling FHE privacy.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Check Pool Liquidity">
    Verify sufficient liquidity exists for your trade size to minimize slippage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Gas Optimization

- **Public swaps** during off-peak hours for lowest fees
- **Batch multiple small swaps** into fewer larger ones
- **Monitor network congestion** before trading
- **Use custom gas settings** for time-sensitive trades

### Privacy Considerations

**Maximum Privacy:**
- Enable FHE for all trades
- Keep majority of funds in Private Balance
- Use different addresses for public/private activity

**Balanced Approach:**
- FHE for large or strategic trades
- Public for routine small swaps
- Mix of public/private based on needs

## Advanced Features (Roadmap)

### Limit Orders

Set specific prices for automatic execution:

- **Private Limit Orders:** Orders with encrypted amounts
- **Good-til-Cancelled:** Remains active until filled or cancelled
- **Fill-or-Kill:** Execute immediately or cancel

### Advanced Routing

Optimize swap paths across multiple pools:

- Multi-hop routing for best prices
- Automatic pool selection
- Split orders across pools
- MEV protection

### Price Charts

Technical analysis tools:

- Real-time price feeds
- Historical charts
- Volume indicators
- Liquidity depth

## Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient Balance for Swap"

- Check you have enough tokens to cover swap amount + gas
- Verify correct balance type (Public vs Private)
- Ensure gas fee reserve (minimum 50,000 OU worth)

### "Slippage Tolerance Exceeded"

- Price moved beyond your tolerance
- Increase slippage tolerance
- Try again when market is less volatile
- Break large trades into smaller chunks

### "Swap Taking Too Long"

- Network congestion can delay processing
- Check transaction status in History tab
- Wait up to 60 seconds during peak times
- Increase gas fee for future trades

### "FHE Swap Failed"

- Ensure sufficient Private Balance
- Verify FHE operations are not rate-limited
- Check network status
- Try public swap as alternative

<Tip>
For urgent trades during congestion, use custom gas fees to set higher OU for priority processing.
</Tip>
