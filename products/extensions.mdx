The **0xio Browser Extension** is your primary gateway to the Octra Network. It allows you to manage assets, interact with dApps, and perform private FHE operations directly from your browser.

## Getting Started

### Installation & Setup
Once installed, you have three ways to set up your vault:

<CardGroup cols="3">
  <Card title="Create New" icon="plus">
    Generates a fresh 12-word seed phrase and a new Octra address (`oct...`).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Import Wallet" icon="file-import">
    Restore an existing wallet using a **Private Key** or **Seed Phrase**.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Watch Mode" icon="eye">
    Track any public address without needing a private key (View Only).
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **Security Tip:** During setup, you can set a **Master Password**. This encrypts your keys on your device. If you skip this, your wallet relies solely on device-level security.
</Note>

## Dashboard Overview

The main screen gives you a snapshot of your financial privacy.

* **Public Balance:** Your visible `OCT` balance, usable for standard transactions and gas fees.
* **Private Balance:** Your FHE-encrypted balance. These funds are visible only to you and are used for shielded transfers.
* **Widgets:** Quick access to price feeds and network status.

## Sending Assets

Navigate to the **Send** tab to transfer funds. 0xio supports two distinct transfer modes:

### 1. Standard vs. Private (FHE)
You can toggle between modes using the slider at the top of the Send screen.

| Mode | Icon | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Standard** | <Icon icon="unlock" /> | A transparent blockchain transaction. Sender, receiver, and amount are public. |
| **Private (FHE)** | <Icon icon="shield" /> | Uses Fully Homomorphic Encryption. The amount is encrypted locally before sending. |

### 2. Bulk Sending
Need to pay multiple people? Switch to **Bulk Mode**.
* **Capacity:** Add up to **5 recipients** in a single transaction batch.
* **Efficiency:** Signs all transactions in one go to save time.

### 3. Network Fees (OU)
For advanced users, you can customize the **Operational Unit (OU)** fee to prioritize transactions during network congestion.
* **Default:** 10,000 OU (Standard) / 30,000 OU (High Value).
* **Custom:** Click "Est. Network Fee" at the bottom to set a custom value.

## Privacy Operations

The **Privacy** tab is the control center for Octra's FHE capabilities. It handles moving funds between your public and private states.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Encrypt (Public → Private)">
    Moves `OCT` from your Public Balance to your Private Balance.
    * *Use case:* Prepare funds for a private transfer.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Decrypt (Private → Public)">
    Moves funds back to your Public Balance.
    * *Use case:* Cashing out or sending to an exchange that doesn't support FHE.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Claim Transfers">
    If someone sends you a **Private Transfer**, it doesn't appear in your balance immediately. You must **Scan & Claim** it here to decrypt the incoming funds and add them to your wallet.
  </Step>
</Steps>
