<Note>
  **Status: In Development**
  The 0xio Mobile Wallet is currently in active development. Features listed below are available in the latest TestFlight/APK builds but may change before public release.
</Note>

The **0xio Mobile App** brings the power of the Octra Network to your pocket. Built with React Native, it offers the same high-grade encryption as the extension but optimized for touch interfaces and mobile security.

## Mobile-Exclusive Features

### Biometric Security
Forget typing passwords every time. The mobile app integrates directly with your device's secure enclave.
* **FaceID / TouchID:** Log in and sign transactions using your unique biometric signature.
* **Secure Storage:** Your encrypted keys are protected by the device's hardware-backed Keychain/Keystore.

## Core Functionality

### Dashboard & Balances
The **Home Screen** provides a dual-view of your assets:
* **Public Balance:** Instantly visible OCT and tokens.
* **Private Balance:** Your FHE-encrypted wealth. Tap the "Eye" icon to reveal (requires authentication).

### Sending Assets
The **Send Flow** is optimized for one-handed use:
* **Scan to Pay:** Use the camera to scan QR codes for instant address entry.
* **Privacy Toggle:** Switch between "Public" and "Private" transfer modes with a single tap.

### Privacy Suite (FHE)
Just like the extension, you have full control over your visibility:
1.  **Encrypt:** Move funds from Public -> Private.
2.  **Decrypt:** Move funds from Private -> Public.
3.  **Claim:** Scan the blockchain for incoming private transfers and add them to your balance.
