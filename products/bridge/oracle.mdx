# The Oracle

The **Oracle** ensures that every bridge transfer happens at a fair, transparent market price. It combines the reliability of an Automated Market Maker (AMM) with the accuracy of real-time off-chain data.

## Hybrid Pricing Engine

The 0xio Oracle uses a unique hybrid model to determine the exchange rate between Octra (OCT) and Stablecoins (USDC/USDT).

### 1. The Virtual USD Pool
Instead of fragmenting liquidity between multiple pairs (OCT/USDC and OCT/USDT), the Oracle combines all stablecoin liquidity into a single **"Virtual USD"** pool.
*   **Benefit:** This creates a deeper liquidity pool, meaning large transfers suffer less "slippage" (price change).
*   **Result:** Whether you withdraw to USDC on Ethereum or USDT on Solana, you get the same fair market rate.

### 2. Pyth Network Integration
To prevent the internal bridge price from deviating from the global market, the Oracle integrates with **Pyth Network**, a high-fidelity real-time price feed.
*   The Oracle constantly checks the global price of OCT, USDC, and USDT.
*   It adjusts the internal curve to match these external prices, ensuring you never pay a significant premium compared to centralized exchanges.

## Protection Mechanisms

### Slippage Protection
When you submit an intent, you specify a `minAmountOut` — the minimum amount of tokens you are willing to accept.
*   If the price changes unfavorably while your transaction is in flight, and the output would fall below your minimum, the Solver will **wait** or **abort** rather than executing a bad trade.

### Liquidity Guard
The Oracle continuously monitors the Solver's available funds on all chains (via the **Watcher Service**). It will never give you a quote for a swap if there isn't enough liquidity to fulfill it immediately.
