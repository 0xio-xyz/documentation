# The Indexer

The **Indexer** is the central nervous system of the 0xio Bridge. While the Solver executes transactions, the Indexer keeps track of what needs to be done.

## The "Post Office" Analogy

Imagine the Bridge as a mail delivery system.
*   **You (The User)** drop a letter (Intent) into the mailbox.
*   **The Indexer** is the post office. It sorts the mail, categorizes it (Deposit vs Withdrawal), and puts it in a "Pending" pile.
*   **The Solver** is the mail carrier. It picks up the pending mail and delivers it.

## Key Responsibilities

### 1. Intent Discovery
The Indexer listens for signals from the 0xio DEX and Wallet Extension. When you sign a transaction, the Indexer records the "Proof of Intent" — the transaction hash and the encrypted instructions.

### 2. State Management
A bridge transaction goes through several states:
*   **PENDING:** The user has paid, waiting for the Solver.
*   **PROCESSING:** The Solver has picked up the task.
*   **COMPLETED:** Funds have been successfully delivered.
*   **FAILED:** Something went wrong (e.g., transaction reverted).

The Indexer maintains this state in real-time, allowing the UI to show you exactly where your funds are.

### 3. Historical Record
The Indexer provides a permanent history of your bridge activity. This allows you to audit your past deposits and withdrawals, even if the user interface or browser cache is cleared.
